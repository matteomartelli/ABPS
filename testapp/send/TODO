- Create an hashtable of structs of sent packets info where the key is the kernel generated id (check glib_hash_table)
- For each fragment TED notification received, add in the hastable sent packet structs the fragment info (appending to a list)
- If the adding fragment has more_frag set to 0 try to recompose the original message. 
- The recompose function sorts the fragment list by frag_off, check if the last has no more_frag and if the total sum (plus udp header) 
is the same of the corresponding sent packet.
- If the recompose succeeds, avg info are calculated and the sent packet struct will be removed from the hashtable.
- Periodically try to recompose the remaing packets of the hashtable and delete those too old summarizing the current information.

hashtable:
	sentpkt 1
		(frag1 frag4 ... fragn)  #When the list is complete and the sizes are same it can be deleted
	sentpkt 2
		(frag2 frag1 ... fragn)
	...
	sentpkt 10
		(frag6 fragn ... frag4)
	...
	sentpkt n
		(fragn frag5 ... frag2)
